\end{marginfigure}
We specialize in working with companies that do not have a software engineering capacity, and are in need of guidance to navigate the myriad of ERP solutions available in the market. For several customers, I serve as a part-time CTO.


My philosophy is that businesses should own as much of their data as possible, and have the power to extract, transform, and load it into any other system or work flow they desire. This gives them the ability design custom alerts and analyses that are unique to their business.

The companies I work with tend to have paper processes that have worked for many years. So, we build custom applications that maintain existing processes, and allows the business to throttle its adoption of new technology over time, rather than make the switch all at once.

\subsection{\textbf{Creative Director (Contract)} at \shstandout{I'm From The Future} \shyears{[Aug 2016-Dec 2016]}}

IFTF is a design and marketing agency based in Philadelphia. I led the design team to re-imagine the marketing website for AvidXchange, a leading Accounts Payable Automation company in Charlotte, NC.

AvidXchange has 5 different products and services that make up its platform, and our job was to create an experience that showcased the breadth and depth of the offering. This involved unifying several different web sites and brands that belonged to standalone products and from acquisitions.

The project was a huge success, launching in December 2016 under a strict deadline.

AvidXchange has since raised over \$300 million from VCs, and is poised for explosive growth.

\subsection{\textbf{Product Manager} at \shstandout{RJMetrics, Inc. (now Magento BI)} \shyears{[Mar 2015-Jul 2016]}}

RJMetrics is a business intelligence platform for SaaS and e-commerce businesses. We were acquired in 2016 by Magento and the platform was rebranded  Magento BI.

My role as a product manager was focused on validating new features for the platform, as well as building a opinion about the future of business intelligence.

It was my job to conduct customer interviews, host and attend industry events, and build relationships that can produce valuable market intelligence for the product team and the company at large. I provided the analysis and design inspiration for a new product, Stitch Data(now a standalone company), that was released to the market in November of 2015.

Stitch Data was a result of my team's work to understand whether the ETL feature set of our current platform was robust enough to be sold as a standalone product.

We conducted over 100 customer interviews and created a version that we developed as an add-on for our existing platform. With that, we were able to validate the offering with our existing customer base and win customers that we had been previously been unable to serve.

Stitch Data allows users to ingest data from popular e-commerce and marketing technologies through their APIs, and deposit it into a data warehouse like, Redshift, Snowflake, and PostgreSQL. The system saves engineering time by providing reliability, fault tolerance, error reporting, and an easy to use UI to manage integrations.

This gives the data engineer visibility into the system, but doesn't hamstring them from writing transformation logic themselves. It gives the analyst the ability to work with data in a language they know, SQL, as well any other tooling that connects to their data warehouse.

The result: \href{https://www.stitchdata.com/}{Stitch Data}

\textit{Robert Moore, CEO, RJMetrics as quoted in the NYTimes}

\end{marginfigure}%

I managed a team of developers that is solving one of the most challenging UX problems of our time: how to make sense of data. With over 1,800+ potential marketing technology data sources, our system needed to be robust to handle the different types of data sent through our pipeline, and the interface needed to be exceptionally flexible.

One of my biggest projects, the report builder, entailed a team of 5 to design, architect, and execute a complete overhaul of our chart building work flow. The project took 6 months, and was measured by the time it took for both experts and novices to complete a battery of test analyses.

We set up both formal and informal user tests throughout the development process that showed vast improvement in the time to create an analysis. In most cases, we saw improvements of about 50\% with certain use cases with 100\%+ improvements.

Most remarkable were the analyses that could now be created that had been just too time consuming to be produced with the previous system. In real terms, this meant an analysis that took 1 hour to complete(begrudgingly) could be completed in under 5 minutes.

\subsection{\textbf{Cofounder, Director of User Experience (UX)} at \shstandout{Jarvus Innovations} \shyears{[Dec 2009-Oct 2011]}}

My role at Jarvus was to manage the experience for our clients'​ users. My responsibilities ranged from project management to diving in and writing code. I designed information architecture deliverables including wire frames, use cases, and activity diagrams, and then managed their execution in a way that maintained a high-quality user experience.
While at Jarvus I led the execution of both the Consumer Reports Mobile Shopper 2011, and the Christie's Auction Mobile Application using the cutting edge Sencha Touch Javascript Framework.


\subsection{\textbf{B.S. Business Administration} at \shstandout{Drexel University} \shyears{[Sep 2005-Jun 2010]}}
I completed Drexel's 5-year program in Business Administration including 3 6-month full-time internships. The first, as a portfolio assistant at Valley Forge Asset Management. The second, as a web developer at FullSix. And, the third, as a web developer for a medical news website built for a team of investors. My GPA was 3.5.
